        <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en">Google News</a></h3>
            <p>This is Google's News website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast</b></li>
                <p>The section titles are all in different colors to tell you they're different from each other. But the titles of news are differrent font then the name of the news source.</p>
                <li><b>Repitition</b></li>
                <p>The news sections are all in same size blocks but the information is all organized the same way for each different block.</p>
                <li><b>Alignment</b></li>
                <p>The different news sections are each in their own blocks. The are all aligned in a grid, so that each section is perfectly fits its space.</p>
                <li><b>Proximity</b></li>
                <p>There are multiple sections of news. For example the local news section only shows news related to the area I am in. Same with the Picks for you section or the Top Stories. Which each have related news to that section. The weather for my area is also right next to my local news.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/">TheBigUglyWebsite</a></h3>
            <p>This a website that is intentionally making itself looking bad.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast</b></li>
                <p>The website uses different colors for a lot of its elements. Including using green as a texts background color with red as the text color. There is also black text placed above an image making it not legible.</p>
                <li><b>Repitition</b></li>
                <p>There is some repition in its lower text areas with a header being black background with white text. There is also some repition with the alignment being slightly off from the left section.</p>
                <li><b>Alignment</b></li>
                <p>The information on the site is sectioned off in two parts. Which all the elements align with but both sections texts aren't aligned with each other. With one sides being higher than the other. </p>
                <li><b>Proximity</b></li>
                <p>There is no clear indication on what is meant to be next to each other. Outside of the title being at the top of the screen. </p>
            </ul>
