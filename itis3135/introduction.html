        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I’m from NC but I’m part of the first generation to be born in the U.S and not Mexico. Also one of the first ones to ever attend a university. Got into video games when I was very little and that turned into loving computers when I was a teen. So, now I’m here trying to better myself in computers.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> Currently don’t have any computer science related work. Was a farmhand for a year.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> Graduated from high school and got an Associates in Science at my community college. Transferred to UNCC to get my bachelors in computer science.</li>
            <li><b>Background in this subject:</b> Have always been interested in working with computers. I took a python course and some digital media courses in high school.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows 10</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & why:</b>
                <ul><li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design & Development:</b> Have always been curious about making a web page for myself. Seemed like a good start.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><b>ITSC 3160 - Database Design & Implementation:</b> Required but also could be useful depending on what I do.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><b>ITIS 31360 - Human-Centered Design:</b> Though it could help with perspective in making things.  </li></ul>
                <ul><li><b>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security & Priv:</b> Like 3146, I could use more knowledge in this field.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><b>ITSC 3146 - Intro Oper Syst & Networking:</b> Felt like I could use more knowledge in the operating system and networking field.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> Being born and raised by Mexican parents, my Spanish is not great. I can have a lengthy conversation and understand 80% of things said. But responding with proper words is where you lose me.</li>
            <li><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> I’m a fan of hockey (Anaheim Ducks), video games (Big into Baldur's Gate 3 right now), anime, and cars, more specifically JDM cars like my 2014 Subaru WRX.</li>
