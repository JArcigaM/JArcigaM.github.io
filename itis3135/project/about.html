            Weymouth is a 5 piece indie punk band from central NC. We try to encapsulate the popular alternative
            sounds of late 2000s to early 2010s while refreshing it with a modern twist. Weymouth focuses on a high
            energy and engaging performance. We wish to provide an audience with an experience they can cherish and
            hopefully inspire others to start bands themselves. The members are: Zane Walsh: Vocals, Dustin Burrell: Guitar and Vocals,
            Brandon Falbo: Bass, Jose Gonzalez: Guitar, John Dâ€™Argenio: Drums
